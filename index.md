## Communism
To reach true communism, we need to dismantle the possibility of corruption at the state of socialism. It is (may be) necessary to think of humans as being inherently evil, in the sense that they will exploit the possibility of corruption if they ever get the chance to. Technology could close that gap of trust and consequently diminish the possibilty of corruption. (This should be true for all political ideologies, not only for socialism or communism)

## Collective Journalism
Nobody has the time nor the energy to research all the facts about every single issue in the world. We heavily rely on the newspapers and the press to get to all the truths of the world. This does only work in the free, liberal and democratic societies of the world. It does not work in china, it does not work in russia. Hell, it even stopped working in the arguably most liberal society on earth, in the united states of america. People started distrusting the press, which they have every right (and I would even say obligation) to do. The dumb one is the one that does not distrust. This is one of the things that most people do not seem to understand, I suspect this is because they simply have not put enough thought into this issue, albeit it being one of the most pressing (ha, pun intended!) ones of our times.

So people rightfully do not trust the news, but how is one supposed to find truth? The distrustful people in america simply switched their dogmatic belief system. They now trust the 'alternative media' instead of the mainstream media, that is the reason for this catastrophic social fragmentation. There are two behemoths on the playing field, each of them ringing for dogmtic believers. How can we reduce this level of dogmatism and turn this into a mixture of trust and individual research? My proposition is collective journalism.

The whole idea is that you do not need to trust strangers, institutions or companies. You mereley need social connections and people that you trust. My whole idea is built onto mankinds biggest accomplishment: social life. You and your social contacts build one humongous journalism construct. Everyone does research on one particular subject which everyone can debate about and -in turn- try to dismantle. One idea might be that of gamification. If the winner of one such debate gets points, then people will try to find weakness or wrongness in other's investigations in order to win the debate and get points. This seems like a hard thing to do in practice because most issues in the world are not black and white, but one can argue that there will always be one 'most true' argumentation or investigation in such a debate.
