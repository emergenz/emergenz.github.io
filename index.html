Hi! I'm a research assistant at <a href="https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en">Helmholtz Munich</a> (<a href="https://aidos.group">AIDOS lab</a>), ex-<a href="https://celonis.com">Celonis</a> software engineer, B. Sc. Informatics student at <a href="https://tum.de">TUM</a> and minoring in Computational Neuroscience (courses of M. Sc. Computational Neuroscience at <a href="https://www.gsn.uni-muenchen.de">LMU Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences</a>).
<br>
<br>
I would love to play Mario Kart via my brain, which is why I am one of the founding members of <a href="https://neurotum.com">neuroTUM</a>. I am interested in representation learning for (read: including, but not limited to) EEG data. I believe that self-supervised pre-training of some form and subsequent fine-tuning will ultimately lead to useful motor-imagery classification algorithms.
<br>
<br>
Besides motor-imagery classification, I am interested in creating intelligent agents that go beyond current language models and are able to reason and plan like biological intelligence. I am also interested in incorporating topological, geometric as well as physical constraints into learning algorithms. To be specific, I would love to create impactful learning algorithms that can be used throughout the drug-discovery process.
